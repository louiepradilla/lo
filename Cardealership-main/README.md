# Cardealership
Car dealership database system

Open the zip file and save the cardealer folder into your SQL server pathroot, it will probably be C:\xampp\htdocs
when the folder is the path open your SQL server in your browser http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
Then create a new database called the dealership and import the file dealership.sql from the cardealer folder
Once all the above is done you will have all the tables, procedures, and triggers created 

Before going further check your username, password, and server name, if they are by default you are good to go, if not
you will have to go into every PHP file and change the setting they are at the top of each page.

Once done go to http://localhost/cardealer/ you will have to sign in with the ADMIN credentials EmployeeID: 2220000 Password: 1234
And you are done


You can now browse around, create new employees and check each employee's access, what a CEO can do and what a salesman can't do and so on



We hope you enjoy it and Best regards!!!!
